# Security Architecture

## Overview

The security architecture is designed to protect data throughout its lifecycle—at rest, in transit, and during processing. It implements multiple layers of protection, follows the principle of least privilege, and ensures compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### Identity Management

- **Auth0 Integration**
  - Single Sign-On (SSO) with multi-factor authentication
  - OIDC-compliant authentication flow
  - Social identity provider integration
  - Enterprise identity federation (SAML, LDAP)

- **Session Management**
  - Short-lived JWT tokens (1 hour expiry)
  - Refresh token rotation
  - Redis-based token blacklisting
  - Session revocation on suspicious activity

- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**
  - Required for administrative actions
  - Optional for regular users
  - Enforced for high-risk operations
  - Backup codes for recovery

### Authorization Model

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Company level roles: Owner, Admin, Member, Guest
  - Room level roles: Owner, Editor, Viewer
  - Roles with pre-defined permission sets

- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
  - Dynamic permissions based on resource attributes
  - Time-based access restrictions
  - Location-based access controls (optional)
  - Context-aware authorization decisions

- **Permission Evaluation Flow**

    A[Request] --> B{Authenticated?}
    B -->|No| C[Reject]
    B -->|Yes| D{Has Role?}
    D -->|No| C
    D -->|Yes| E{Check Permissions}
    E -->|Has Permission| F[Allow]
    E -->|No Permission| G{Check Attributes}
    G -->|Allowed| F
    G -->|Denied| C
  ```

## 2. Data Protection

### Encryption Strategy

- **Data in Transit**

- **Data at Rest**
  - Client-side encryption (E2EE)
    - AES-256-GCM for file content
    - PBKDF2 for key derivation
    - Argon2 for password hashing
  - Server-side encryption (SSE)
    - Provider-managed encryption (Wasabi/Storj)
    - AWS KMS for key management
    - Envelope encryption for metadata

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) Implementation**
  - Browser-based encryption using Web Crypto API
  - Per-file encryption keys
  - Secure key sharing via asymmetric encryption
  - Zero-knowledge architecture for sensitive files

### Key Management

- **Key Hierarchy**

  ```
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │ Master Key (AWS KMS)│
  └───────────┬─────────┘
              │
              ▼
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │ Data Encryption Keys│
  └───────────┬─────────┘
              │
              ▼
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │ File Encryption Keys│
  └─────────────────────┘
  ```
