# Development Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic approach for migrating the file transfer application from LoopBack 4 to Express. The roadmap prioritizes features based on business value, technical dependencies, and risk mitigation, with clear milestones and deliverables for each phase.

### Key Technical Risks

| Risk                           | Mitigation Strategy                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data migration issues          | Early DB schema development, comprehensive testing, migration dry runs |
| Performance regression         | Performance benchmarking, load testing, performance budgets            |
| Auth integration complexity    | Early implementation, incremental approach, fallback mechanisms        |
| WebSocket scaling challenges   | Redis adapter implementation, load testing, scaling verification       |
| Storage provider compatibility | Abstraction layer, provider-specific tests, fallback mechanisms        |

### Contingency Planning

1. **Schedule Buffer**: Each phase includes a 15% time buffer
2. **Feature Prioritization**: Clear understanding of must-have vs. nice-to-have features
3. **Technical Alternatives**: Backup approaches for high-risk components
4. **Incremental Deployment**: Capability to partially deploy and roll back

## Migration Approach Details

### Pattern 1: Parallel Implementation

For less critical features, implement in Express while maintaining LoopBack functionality:

1. Develop Express implementation
2. Test thoroughly in isolation
3. Deploy alongside LoopBack
4. Gradually shift traffic using feature flags
5. Decommission LoopBack implementation

### Pattern 2: Lift and Shift

For isolated features with minimal dependencies:

1. Develop Express replacement
2. Test thoroughly
3. Deploy as direct replacement
4. Monitor for issues
5. Remove LoopBack implementation

### Pattern 3: Proxy Approach

For complex, interconnected features:

1. Implement API compatibility layer in Express
2. Initially proxy requests to LoopBack
3. Gradually replace proxied endpoints with native implementations
4. Remove proxy functionality once migration is complete

| Room Management         | Parallel Implementation | Phase 4              |
| Sharing                 | Lift and Shift          | Phase 4              |
| Storage Integration     | Parallel Implementation | Phase 5              |

## Summary

This roadmap provides a comprehensive plan for migrating the file transfer application from LoopBack 4 to Express over a 24-week period. By following a phased approach with clear milestones and deliverables, we can ensure a smooth transition while maintaining service continuity and adding value throughout the process.

The migration is structured to address the highest risks and most critical components early, providing a solid foundation for subsequent phases. By implementing a combination of migration patterns tailored to each feature area, we can optimize the development effort and minimize disruption.

Regular reviews and adjustments to the roadmap will be conducted at the completion of each phase to incorporate lessons learned and adapt to changing requirements.
